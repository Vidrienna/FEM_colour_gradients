# Vector colour gradients using PolyFEM

The culmination of 4 months of compressed work on creating gradients in 2D vector planes.

This project is capable of generating dual-sided diffusion curves and images with location-dependent diffusion constants. PolyFEM is heavily used for computation.

This repository is a compilation of testing files used to advance knowledge and ability to generate 2D vector planes with increased control over colour and gradients.

First_Napkin_DiffConstTest and MultiDualSide are the most recent and most advanced files. Work is still being done on MultiDualSide, which incorporates multiple dual-sided diffusion curves, but First_Napkin_DiffConstTest is a complete example of generating an image using location-dependent diffusion constants. Most other files are for testing and learning.
